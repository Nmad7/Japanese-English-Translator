# Japanese-English-Translator
An attempt at a neural network translator that takes Japanese and goes to English
Parallel corpus data (combo2.txt) to train the network was taken from two sites and the corpus were combined, then long sentences were removed.

To use:

Run engjapfa.py to generate models. Then name the best model "model.hdf5" and run gui.py to interact graphically.
